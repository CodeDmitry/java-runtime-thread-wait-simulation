# java-runtime-thread-wait-simulation
A proof of concept for simulating Java's "wait for threads to finish before process termination" behavior.

There are bugs in this implementation, do not use in anything serious.

-build.sh makes the exponential test.
-build2.sh makes the simple test.
-buildpoc.sh makes the single-file test(obsolete).
